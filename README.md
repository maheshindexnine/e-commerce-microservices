# üì¶ E-commerce Microservices with NestJS

This project implements a microservice-based architecture for an e-commerce application using **NestJS**. The application is divided into multiple services that run on different ports, and each service has its own responsibility:

- **User Service**: Handles user management (registration, login, etc.)
- **Product Service**: Manages product data and product-related operations.
- **Order Service**: Handles order processing and order details.
- **Gateway Service**: The entry point for all requests, which orchestrates communication between the other services.

The services communicate with each other using **NestJS Microservices** (TCP transport) and **JWT for authentication**.

- Product management (add, update, delete, get details).
